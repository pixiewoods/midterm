#MEAN Midterm Project

 Online Art Gallery

* Display artist bio and artwork with basic descriptions including pics
* Provide ability to add new artworks (should separate this from list view in future; assume admin user only has rights to this function)
* Provide ability to purchase artwork (future version)

 Challenges / Outstanding Issues

* Not all artwork pics are same size. Makes for inconsistent bootstrap panel sizes and I've not yet figured out the remedy.
* Still experiencing learning curve with CSS/SCSS
